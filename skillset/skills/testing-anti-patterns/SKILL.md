description: Use when writing or changing tests, adding mocks, or tempted to add test-only methods to production code - prevents testing mock behavior, production pollution with test-only methods, and mocking without understanding dependencies
---

<required>
Add the following steps to your task tracking tool.

1. Verify that every assertion on a mock checks real behavior, not just that the mock exists; delete or unmock any assertion that only checks mock existence.
2. Check whether any method you added to a production class is called only by tests; if it is, move it to a test utility — a test-only `destroy()`/`reset()` on a production class can fire in production.
3. For each mock, name the real method's side effects and identify which ones the test depends on; mock the slow or external operation at the lowest level, never the high-level method the test needs. When unsure, run the test against the real implementation first and observe what it needs.
4. Confirm each mock response mirrors the complete real structure, including fields this test does not read — a partial mock passes here and fails silently in integration.
5. Check every assertion that a file or string contains specific prose: if the expected value was copied out of the file under test, replace it with a structural, schema, or invariant check, or delete it — there is no independent oracle.
6. Write the test first and confirm it fails against real code before adding any mock.

## Testing mock behavior

Asserting a mock exists proves the mock works, not the code — a correct and an incorrect component pass equally.

<bad_example>
expect(screen.getByTestId('sidebar-mock')).toBeInTheDocument();
</bad_example>
<good_example>
// render the real sidebar, then assert its role
expect(screen.getByRole('navigation')).toBeInTheDocument();
</good_example>

## Test-only methods in production

A method only tests call pollutes the production class and can be called by accident in production. Keep the production class to its real lifecycle; put test cleanup in a `test-utils` helper the test calls in `afterEach`.

## Mocking without understanding

Over-mocking "to be safe" strips side effects the test depends on, so it passes or fails for the wrong reason.

<bad_example>
// mocks away the config write the duplicate check depends on
vi.mock('ToolCatalog', () => ({ discoverAndCacheTools: vi.fn() }));
</bad_example>
<good_example>
// mock only the slow server startup; keep the behavior under test real
vi.mock('MCPServerManager');
</good_example>

## Incomplete mocks

A mock that omits fields downstream code reads stays green while integration breaks. Mirror the full response schema, not just the fields your immediate assertion touches.

## Tests as afterthought

"Implementation done, tests later" is unfinished work. Write a failing test, implement to pass, refactor, then claim done.

## Change-detector (content-mirror) tests

Asserting a doc, config, or seed file contains a sentence copied out of that same file has no independent oracle: it only proves the file equals itself, breaks on any reword, and passes even when the surrounding content is wrong.

<bad_example>
// the expected value is a fragment of the file under test
const body = readFileSync('AGENTS.md', 'utf-8');
expect(body).toContain('8 GB');
expect(body).toContain('plain text');
</bad_example>
<good_example>
// assert something true independent of the prose
expect(() => JSON.parse(readFileSync('config.json', 'utf-8'))).not.toThrow();
expect(body).not.toContain(SECRET_KEY); // ongoing invariant: must never appear
for (const dep of manifest.dependencies.skills) expect(existsSync(dep)).toBe(true);
</good_example>

This is the test an agent writes by reflex — "assert the doc contains the line I just added" — so it regenerates whenever someone adds prose to a seed, doc, or prompt file. Catch it in review; a linter cannot reliably separate a prose mirror from a legitimate structural check, because that needs to know whether the asserted value was read from a static file or computed by the code under test.

A negative assertion earns its place only when the banned string has an ongoing, forward-looking reason to be forbidden — a secret, an internal codename, a rename that must stay reverted. A `not.toContain('the-file-we-deleted')` that just pins a one-time cleanup is a change-detector too: it rarely recurs and reads as a reviewed requirement to the next person. Cut it.

Content-presence assertions that are fine: it parses or is well-formed; a required key or type exists; something must never appear; or an exact string that is itself a machine-parsed contract — sourced from the single source of truth, not a hand-copied duplicate.

## When a mock gets complex

Mock setup longer than the test, mocks missing methods the real object has, or a test that breaks every time the mock changes all mean you should use the real component. Integration tests with real collaborators are often simpler than elaborate mocks.
