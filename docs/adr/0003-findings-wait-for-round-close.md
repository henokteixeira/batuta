# Findings wait for round close

2026-09-08

An agent that notices something outside its slice writes one line in the findings note, and nothing else happens in that round: no ticket, no label, no plan change, no dispatch, however urgent. At round close the Orchestrator marks each line "⇒ candidate" or "⇒ recommend discard" and deletes nothing; only the Definer, with Henok, turns a line into a ticket or discards it. A production emergency is the single exception, and even then it is one line in "for you" and Henok decides.

Considered options: the Orchestrator ticketing findings the same day, rejected because that is how ENG-908 was dispatched undefined on 2026-09-08.

2026-09-11: the Definer opens every session by reading the findings note itself and putting the marked lines that still stand to Henok, so he does not have to remember to ask; this widens nothing under ADR 0005, since the findings came from rounds he opened and each line is his decision. A finding that falls on the code paths of a ticket already defined and waiting for a manifest is folded onto it; one that touches none becomes a ticket of its own.

2026-09-28: a defect in code a diff of the open round changed is not a finding. While its PR is open it goes back to that slice's executor; once merged, it becomes a follow-up slice on the same ticket, planned from the plan on disk, inside the concurrency limit. No new ticket is born, so the reason for this ADR stands. About nine defects the reviewers caught in the round of 2026-09-25 had become the next round's tickets under the old rule. After the state note, every defect is a finding again.
